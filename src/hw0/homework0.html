  Not technically "sources" but here are the things I used on this page that I didn't personally write (not the rest of the site):
  - Tailwind, for utility classes (https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - Inter, for the typeface (https://rsms.me/inter/)

  Hopefully this doesn't matter though since neither of these affect the core deliverable for this assignment.

          The main reason I use VS Code for web development is because I think
          it's easier than something like Neovim when dealing with the JS/TS
          ecosystem. It also integrates very well with WSL2, which is where I do
          most of my development since I can't be bothered to run Linux on my
          laptop. Also, other people are familiar with it so it's easier to
          review code with people and ask for help when I'm in VS Code.

          However, this only applies for web development. I learned Go in Neovim
          when I was taking CSO1 to get better at using Vim so that's now that's
          just the IDE that feels right to me for writing Go (and C). The bonus
          is of course that I get to look cool for using Neovim whenever I'm
          writing Go, even if I'm writing the most horrible code on the planet
          and have no idea what I'm doing :)
