  Not technically "sources" but here are the things I used on this page that I didn't personally write (not the rest of the site):
  - Tailwind, for utility classes (https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - Inter, for the typeface (https://rsms.me/inter/)

  Hopefully this doesn't matter though since neither of these affect the core deliverable for this assignment.

        The main reason I use VS Code for web development is because I think it's easier than something like Neovim when
        dealing with the JS/TS ecosystem.
        It also integrates very well with WSL2, which is where I do most of my development since I can't be bothered to
        run Linux on my laptop. Also, other people are familiar with it so it's easier to review code with people
        and ask for help when I'm in VS Code.

        However, this only applies for web development. I learned Go in Neovim when I was taking CSO1 to get better at
        using Vim so that's now that's just the IDE that feels right to me for writing Go (and C). The bonus is of
        course that I get to look cool for using Neovim whenever I'm writing Go, even if I'm writing the most horrible
        code on the planet and have no idea what I'm doing :)
